# msw-signalr

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4ba6b11: # Migrate to MSW 2.x

  Mock Service Worker 2 features stream responses, which makes mocking a SignalR hub significantly easier. The mock request handler implementation now uses Server Sent Events instead of Long-Polling.

  ## API changes

  `signalRHandlers` was renamed to `signalRHub` to better reflect the changed role:

  ```diff
  - import { signalRHandlers } from "msw-signalr";
  + import { signalRHub } from "msw-signalr"
  ```

  `signalRHub` returns an object with `handlers`, `connections`, and `broadcast` function, which takes the role of the formally global `send`.

  ```diff
  - export const server = setupServer(...signalRhandlers("/hub"));
  + export const hub = signalRHub("/hub");
  + export const worker = setupWorker(...hub.handlers);
  ```

  ```diff
  - send("foo", "bar")
  + hub.broadcast("foo", "bar")
  ```

  The `connections` property can now be used to send messages to individual clients:

  ```js
  hub.connections.get("some-id").send("foo", "bar");
  ```
